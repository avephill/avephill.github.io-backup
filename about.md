<br>

I am an ecologist and plant biologist studying human impacts on plant distributions. 
I source and contribute to large-scale plant occurrence datasets which I use in statistical modeling research to address questions related to the species composition and range limits of future forests. 
<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ancene.2017.09.001" target="_blank"> The Anthropocene</a> is causing a global redistribution of plants and animals, and my goal is to use principles from both biology and philosophy to determine where plants "belong" in the coming decades and centuries.

Presently, I'm a postdoctoral researcher at the California Academy of Sciences where I leverage vast amounts of community science data to model ecological patterns across California.
I also am working on tools to 'give back' to community scientists the ecological insights that their work makes possible.
