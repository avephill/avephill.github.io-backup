### Motivation
In the broadest terms, I am interested in the determinants of where plants belong. Though entirely entertwined, I think that these determinants can be differentiated as either biological or anthropogenic. At this point on the geologic timeline where humans have exerted influence over the entire biosphere, the distinction between biological and anthropogenic are tenuous— still, I find it useful to ask two questions in parallel when considering the determinants responsible for a plant growing in a particular place:
1. What biological needs (water, light, nutrients) are satisfied and restrictions (competition, toxins, temperature extremes) absent at this location?


2. What anthropogenic factors and decisions (resource extraction, conservation efforts, agriculture) are responsible for the conditions at this location?

In acknowledging that human decisions have, and will continue to play, an important role in setting the vegetation distributions of the future, a large suite of disciplines is necessary to map the vegetation of the coming decades and centuries, including traditional biogeography, climate change science, environmental ethics, urban ecology, environmental sociology, etc.

### General Methods
I spend much of my time behind a computer, using R, QGIS, and Python to manipulate, analyze, and map geographic locations of plant species and vegetation types across the western U.S. I often source occurrence data from iNaturalist, GBIF, and the USFS Forest Inventory Analysis and use species distribution modeling to answer questions regarding the shifts in plant distributions over time, their potential determinants, and their rates of change.

Outside of (but intimately connected to) this computational work I am interested in understanding the ethics surrounding interventionist conservation practices like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assisted_colonization" target="_blank">assisted colonization</a>.
