This is a javascript flashcard program that helps a person learn plant species in a particular geographic area. It uses an R script to build the image directories and csv files necessary for the flashcard program to work.
The flashcards are grouped by 10 plants so that a user can learn a few plants before moving on to the next group.

The front of each card looks like:

And back:

If you're interested in messing around with an incomplete but functional(\?) version you can do so <a href="{{ '/flashcard' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" target="_blank">here</a>
