I wanted to make a dress for a friend that is too tall and broad-shouldered for most dresses-- furthermore, I wanted the material to be good for hiking: light, quickdrying, and breathable. Apparently <a href="https://www.rockywoods.com/Supplex-Nylon-Fabric-Rust" target="_blank">taslanated nylon</a> is a material with these properties, commonly used to make various outdoor clothing. I turned a <a href="https://sewguide.com/a-line-dress-pattern/#method_2_a_simple_a_line_dress_with_neck_binding" target="_blank">sewing guide</a> for a simple A-line dress into an R script that builds a dress pattern from 3 simple body measurements. After inputing height, bust, and shoulder measurements, the program (which you can access/use <a href="https://avephill.shinyapps.io/Auto_Dress_Pattern/" target="_blank">here</a>) produces something like this:

This can then be mapped onto parchment paper and cut out to form a pattern:

After cutting out the material from the patterns, I sewed the top of the shoulders, and down the sides of the dress, and added <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias_tape" target="_blank">bias tape</a> to the neckline and arm holes. I finished by hemming the bottom to the desired height.
