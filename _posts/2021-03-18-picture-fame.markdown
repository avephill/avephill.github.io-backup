Here's instructions for how I made a picture frame, along with a webapp to help facilitate the measurements for future picture frames.

**The tools I used are**
* ruler
* table saw
* miter saw
* band clamp

**Materials I used**
* scrap plank, 3/4" thick
* picture hanger
* plexiglass / glass
* cardboard
* wood glue

<a href="https://not_yet.net" target="_blank">Here's the webapp</a> where you can figure out particular measurements. The width I used for this frame was 1" and the picture size was 5" x 7".
First I cut a 1+5/16" piece

And then proceeded to cut two grooves in it, at 3/16" deep and 5/16" deep.

Then I turned the piece sideways, and cut to the depth of the 3/16" groove-- cutting out the backside

I cut two slats to hold the picture frame in from the back instead

Then glued the pieces together, clamped it with a band clamp, cut cardboard to 5" x 7", and screwed in the picture hanger mount

Cut a piece of plastic, plexiglass, glass, etc. and put it right on in
